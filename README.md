# Dashboard-Angular

This project was created for being used in my actual projects and future, giving a good template for start off.

This template was designed using Angular and PrimeNG framework, but styling the components to give it a modern look. 
It uses modularization for high customization. You can clone and use it as you want, for learning purposes or use it in projects.

Navigate to localhost:4200/home, to look it.
